    <h2>Web Developer & AI Enthusiast</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm Meir, a passionate full-stack web developer with a keen interest in AI integration.
      With over 2 years of experience in the field, I specialize in crafting efficient and
      innovative web solutions that bridge the gap between cutting-edge technology and user-friendly
      design.
    </p>
    <p>My toolkit includes a wide range of technologies, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Astro</li>
      <li>Svelte</li>
      <li>React</li>
      <li>NextJS</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
      <li>TypeScript</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By day, I'm deeply involved in end-to-end web development projects in Israel, pushing the
      boundaries of what's possible in web technology. By night, I explore the exciting frontier of
      AI with a US-based company, constantly learning and adapting to the rapidly evolving tech
      landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      My passion lies in creating web solutions that not only meet technical requirements but also
      delight users with their intuitiveness and efficiency. I believe in the power of clean,
      maintainable code and the importance of staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and
      best practices.
    </p>
    <h2>Let's Connect!</h2>
    <p>
      I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers, tech enthusiasts, and potential
      collaborators. Whether you have questions about my projects, want to discuss the latest in web
      development and AI, or are interested in working together, feel free to reach out!
