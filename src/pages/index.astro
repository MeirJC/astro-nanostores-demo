      <p class="mb-4">
        Welcome to the demo site for my upcoming Hashnode article, "[Article Title Placeholder]".
        This project showcases the power of using <a
          href="https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores"
          class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">nanostores</a
        > in <a href="https://astro.build" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">Astro</a>,
        demonstrating how to manage state across multiple frameworks (Astro, Svelte, React, and Vue)
        - both with their own state and with shared state. It's like a United Nations summit, but
        for front-end frameworks!

      <h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">Why Nanostores in Astro?</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Imagine you're at a party (a web development party, of course) and you want to share a juicy
        piece of gossip (let's call it "state") with your friends who speak different languages
        (frameworks). Nanostores is like that cool polyglot friend who can translate your gossip
        into any language effortlessly.
      </p>
      <ul class="mb-4 list-inside list-disc">
        <li>Lightweight and framework-agnostic - it plays nice with everyone!</li>
        <li>Perfect for Astro's component islands - like little state management oases</li>
        <li>Shared state across frameworks - because sharing is caring</li>
        <li>Simple API - no PhD in State Management required</li>
      </ul>
      <p>

        on Hashnode. It's where the real magic happens!
